# E-Commerce-Demand-Forecasting-and-Personalization
1. Define the Problem and Objectives

    Goal: Forecast product demand and provide personalized product recommendations to optimize inventory and improve customer experience.
    Key Outputs:
        A demand forecasting model.
        A recommendation system.
        An interactive dashboard for insights.
        Efficient deployment solutions.

2. Collect and Preprocess Data
2.1. Gather Data

    Demand Forecasting:
        Historical sales data (e.g., order quantities, dates, categories, prices).
        Seasonal, holiday, and promotional data.
        Metadata about products.
    Recommender System:
        User purchase history.
        Product details (e.g., descriptions in Persian).
        Ratings and reviews.

2.2. Preprocess Data

    Use Pandas and NumPy for preprocessing:
        Handle missing values.
        Normalize and scale numerical features.
        Encode categorical features.
    For Persian text, use Hazm:
        Tokenization, stemming, stopword removal.
        Convert Persian text into vector embeddings (e.g., using BERT or Word2Vec trained on Persian corpora).

3. Build the Demand Forecasting Model
3.1. Feature Engineering

    Create lag features for sales (e.g., sales from the past week, month).
    Add external features (e.g., holidays, weather).
    Aggregate data by time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).

3.2. Model Training

    Baseline Model: Train a simple Linear Regression model for comparison.
    Advanced Models:
        Use XGBoost for structured data.
        Use LSTMs or GRUs for time-series forecasting.
        Use frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning models.
    Evaluate:
        Metrics: RMSE, MAPE, MAE.
        Cross-validation for robust results.

4. Build the Recommendation System
4.1. Collaborative Filtering

    Use Surprise library to:
        Train a matrix factorization model (e.g., SVD).
        Predict user preferences based on user-item interaction matrices.

4.2. Content-Based Recommendations

    Extract features from Persian text using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or Persian BERT.
    Match product attributes with user preferences.

4.3. Hybrid Recommender

    Combine predictions from collaborative filtering and content-based models to enhance recommendations.

5. Integrate Big Data Tools
5.1. Data Storage

    Use MongoDB for semi-structured data like product descriptions and reviews.
    Use Cassandra for time-series data like sales records.

5.2. Data Processing

    Use Apache Spark for distributed data processing:
        Transform and clean large datasets.
        Perform real-time data aggregations.

5.3. Batch Processing

    Use Hadoop to process historical data for model retraining.

6. Optimize Models for Deployment
6.1. Model Compression

    Pruning: Remove less significant weights in neural networks.
    Quantization: Convert 32-bit weights to 8-bit for deployment on edge devices.
    Use tools like TensorFlow Lite or ONNX for this.

6.2. Real-Time API Deployment

    Wrap trained models using Flask or FastAPI.
    Containerize using Docker for portability.
    Use Nginx as a reverse proxy for APIs.

7. Develop a Dashboard

    Use Tableau or Power BI to create:
        Inventory status visualizations.
        Sales trends over time.
        Customer engagement metrics.
